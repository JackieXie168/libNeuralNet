\index{OpenNN namespace}

Each set of definitions in the \texttt{OpenNN} library is `wrapped'
in the namespace \lstinline"OpenNN". In this way, if some other
definition has an identical name, but is in a different namespace,
then there is no conflict.

The \lstinline"using" directive makes a namespace available
throughout the file where it is written \cite{Eckel2000}. For the
\lstinline"OpenNN" namespace the following sentence can be written:

\begin{lstlisting}
using namespace OpenNN;
\end{lstlisting}
