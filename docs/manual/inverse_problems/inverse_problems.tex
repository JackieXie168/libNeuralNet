Iverse problems are the most complex applications for neural networks, 
since learning is performed here from both mathematical models and data sets. 
\texttt{OpenNN} classes which are related to the solution of inverse problems include the mathematical model, the data set,  
several performance term classes and the testing analysis classes.
